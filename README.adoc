= Pipeable

A DSL for workflows built atop native {function_composition_link} which leverages the {railway_pattern_link}. This allows you to write a sequence of _steps_ that cleanly read from left-to-right or top-to-bottom which results in a success or a failure without having to rely on exceptions which are expensive and should not be used for control flow.

toc::[]

== Features

* Built atop of native {function_composition_link}.
* Adheres to the {railway_pattern_link}.
* Provides built-in and customizable domain-specific steps.
* Provides chainable _pipes_ which can be used to build more complex workflows.
* Compatible with the {containable_link}, {infusible_link}, and {dry_monads_link} gems.

== Requirements

. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby].
. A strong understanding of {function_composition_link}.

== Setup

To install _with_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
# üí° Skip this line if you already have the public certificate installed.
gem cert --add <(curl --compressed --location https://alchemists.io/gems.pem)
gem install pipeable --trust-policy HighSecurity
----

To install _without_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install pipeable
----

You can also add the gem directly to your project:

[source,bash]
----
bundle add pipeable
----

Once the gem is installed, you only need to require it:

[source,ruby]
----
require "pipeable"
----

== Usage

You can turn any object into a _transaction_ by requiring and including this gem as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
require "csv"
require "pipeable"

class Demo
  include Pipeable

  def initialize client: CSV
    @client = client
  end

  def call data
    pipe data,
         check(/Book.+Price/, :match?),
         :parse,
         map { |item| "#{item[:book]}: #{item[:price]}" }
  end

  private

  attr_reader :client

  def parse result
    result.fmap do |data|
      client.instance(data, headers: true, header_converters: proc { |key| key.downcase.to_sym })
            .to_a
            .map(&:to_h)
    end
  end
end
----

The above allows `Demo#call` to be a sequence steps which may pass or fail due to all step being {dry_monads_link}. This is the essence of the {railway_pattern_link}.

To execute the above example, you'd only need to pass CSV content to it:

[source,ruby]
----
Demo.new.call <<~CSV
  Book,Author,Price,At
  Mystics,urGoh,10.50,2022-01-01
  Skeksis,skekSil,20.75,2022-02-13
CSV
----

The computed result is a success with each book listing a price:

....
Success ["Mystics: 10.50", "Skeksis: 20.75"]
....

=== Pipe

Once you've included the `Pipeable` module within your class, the `#pipe` method is available to you and is how you build a sequence of steps for processing. The method signature is:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe(input, *steps)
----

The first argument is your input which can be a Ruby primitive or a monad. Regardless, the input will be automatically wrapped as a `Success` -- but only if not a `Result` to begin with -- before passing to the first step. From there, all steps are _required_ to answer a monad in order to adhere to the {railway_pattern_link}.

Behind the scenes, the `#pipe` method is syntactic sugar on top of {function_composition_link} which means if this code were to be rewritten:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe csv,
     check(/Book.+Price/, :match?),
     :parse,
     map { |item| "#{item[:book]}: #{item[:price]}" }
----

Then the above would look like this using native Ruby:

[source,ruby]
----
(
  check(/Book.+Price/, :match?) >>
  method(:parse) >>
  map { |item| "#{item[:book]}: #{item[:price]}" }
).call Success(csv)
----

The problem with native function composition is that it reads backwards by passing your input at the end of all sequential steps. With the `#pipe` method, you have the benefit of allowing your eye to read the code from top to bottom in addition to not having to type multiple _forward composition_ operators.

=== Steps

There are several ways to compose steps for your pipe. As long as all steps succeed, you'll get a successful response. Otherwise, the first step to fail will pass the failure down by skipping all subsequent steps (unless you dynamically attempt to turn the failure into a success). The following sections detail how to mix and match steps for building a robust implementation.

==== Basic

The following are the basic (default) steps for building for more advanced functionality.

===== As

Allows you to message the input as different output. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe :a, as(:inspect)                  # Success ":a"
pipe %i[a b c], as(:dig, 1)            # Success :b
pipe Failure("Danger!"), as(:inspect)  # Failure "Danger!"
----

===== Bind

Allows you to perform operations on a successful result only. You are then responsible for answering a success or failure accordingly. This is a convenience wrapper to native {dry_monads_link} `#bind` functionality. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe %i[a b c], bind { |input| Success input.join("-") }           # Success "a-b-c"
pipe %i[a b c], bind { |input| Failure input }                     # Failure [:a, :b, :c]
pipe Failure("Danger!"), bind { |input| Success input.join("-") }  # Failure "Danger!"
----

===== Check

Allows you to check if the input and messaged object evaluate to `true` or `Success`. When successful, input is passed through as a `Success`. When false, input is passed through as a `Failure`. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe :a, check(%i[a b], :include?)                  # Success :a
pipe :a, check(%i[b c], :include?)                  # Failure :a
pipe Failure("Danger!"), check(%i[a b], :include?)  # Failure "Danger!"
----

===== Fmap

Allows you to unwrap a successful operation, make a modification, and rewrap the modification as a new success. This is a convenience wrapper to native {dry_monads_link} `#fmap` functionality. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe %i[a b c], fmap { |input| input.join "-" }           # Success "a-b-c"
pipe Failure("Danger!"), fmap { |input| input.join "-" }  # Failure "Danger!"
----

===== Insert

Allows you to insert an element after the input (default behavior) and wraps native link:https://rubyapi.org/o/array#method-i-insert[Array#insert] functionality. If the input is not an array, it will be cast as one. You can use the `:at` key to specify where you want insertion to happen. This step is most useful when needing to assemble arguments for passing to a subsequent step. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe :a, insert(:b)                  # Success [:a, :b]
pipe :a, insert(:b, at: 0)           # Success [:b, :a]
pipe %i[a c], insert(:b, at: 1)      # Success [:a, :b, :c]
pipe Failure("Danger!"), insert(:b)  # Failure "Danger!"
----

===== Map

Allows you to map over an enumerable and wraps native link:https://rubyapi.org/o/enumerable#method-i-map[Enumerable#map] functionality.

[source,ruby]
----
pipe %i[a b c], map(&:inspect)           # Success [":a", ":b", ":c"]
pipe Failure("Danger!"), map(&:inspect)  # Failure "Danger!"
----

===== Merge

Allows you to merge the input with additional attributes as a single hash. If the input is not a hash, then the input will be merged with the attributes using `step` as the key. The default `step` key can be renamed to a different key by using the `:as` key. Like the _Insert_ step, this is most useful when needing to assemble arguments and/or data for consumption by subsequent steps. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe({a: 1}, merge(b: 2))             # Success {a: 1, b: 2}
pipe "test", merge(b: 2)              # Success {step: "test", b: 2}
pipe "test", merge(as: :a, b: 2)      # Success {a: "test", b: 2}
pipe Failure("Danger!"), merge(b: 2)  # Failure "Danger!"
----

===== Orr

Allows you to operate on a failure and produce either a success or another failure. This is a convenience wrapper to native {dry_monads_link} `#or` functionality.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Syntactically, `or` can't be used for this step since `or` is a native Ruby keyword so `orr` is used instead.

Example:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe %i[a b c], orr { |input| Success input.join("-") }          # Success [:a, :b, :c]
pipe Failure("Danger!"), orr { Success "Resolved" }              # Success "Resolved"
pipe Failure("Danger!"), orr { |input| Failure "Big #{input}" }  # Failure "Big Danger!"
----

===== Tee

Allows you to run an operation and ignore the response while input is passed through as output. This behavior is similar in nature to the link:https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gawk/manual/html_node/Tee-Program.html[tee] program in Bash. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe "test", tee(Kernel, :puts, "Example.")

# Example.
# Success "test"

pipe Failure("Danger!"), tee(Kernel, :puts, "Example.")

# Example.
# Failure "Danger!"
----

===== To

Allows you to delegate to an object -- which doesn't have a callable interface and may or may not answer a result -- for processing of input. If the response is not a monad, it'll be automatically wrapped as a `Success`. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
Model = Struct.new :label, keyword_init: true do
  include Dry::Monads[:result]

  def self.for(...) = Success new(...)
end

pipe({label: "Test"}, to(Model, :for))    # Success #<struct Model label="Test">
pipe Failure("Danger!"), to(Model, :for)  # Failure "Danger!"
----

===== Try

Allows you to try an operation which may fail while catching the exception as a failure for further processing. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe "test", try(:to_json, catch: JSON::ParserError)     # Success "\"test\""
pipe "test", try(:invalid, catch: NoMethodError)         # Failure "undefined method..."
pipe Failure("Danger!"), try(:to_json, catch: JSON::ParserError)  # Failure "Danger!"
----

===== Use

Allows you to use another transaction which might have multiple steps of it's own, use an object that adheres to the {command_pattern_link}, or any function which answers a {dry_monads_link} `Result` object. In other words, you can use _use_ any object which responds to `#call` and answers a {dry_monads_link} `Result` object. This is great for chaining multiple transactions together.

[source,ruby]
----
function = -> input { Success input * 3 }

pipe 3, use(function)                   # Success 9
pipe Failure("Danger!"), use(function)  # Failure "Danger!"
----

===== Validate

Allows you to use an operation that will validate the input. This is especially useful when using {dry_schema_link}, {dry_validation_link}, or any operation that can respond to `#call` while answering a result that can be converted into a hash.

By default, the `:as` key uses `:to_h` as it's value so you get automatic casting to a `Hash`. Use `nil`, as the value, to disable this behavior. You can also pass in any value to the `:as` key which is a valid method that the result will respond to.

[source,ruby]
----
schema = Dry::Schema.Params { required(:label).filled :string }

pipe({label: "Test"}, validate(schema))           # Success label: "Test"
pipe({label: "Test"}, validate(schema, as: nil))  # Success #<Dry::Schema::Result{:label=>"Test"} errors={} path=[]>
pipe Failure("Danger!"), validate(schema)         # Failure "Danger!"
----

==== Advanced

Several options are available should you need to advance beyond the basic steps. Each is described in detail below.

===== Procs

You can always use a `Proc` as a custom step. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
include Pipeable
include Dry::Monads[:result]

pipe :a,
     insert(:b),
     proc { Success "input_ignored" },
     as(:to_sym)

# Yields: Success :input_ignored
----

===== Lambdas

In addition to procs, lambdas can be used too. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
include Pipeable

pipe :a,
     insert(:b),
     -> result { result.fmap { |input| input.join "_" } },
     as(:to_sym)

# Yields: Success :a_b
----

===== Methods

Methods -- in addition to procs and lambdas -- are the _preferred_ way to add custom steps due to the concise syntax. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
class Demo
  include Pipeable

  def call input
    pipe :a,
         insert(:b),
         :join,
         as(:to_sym)
  end

  private

  def join(result) = result.fmap { |input| input.join "_" }
end

Demo.new.call :a  # Yields: Success :a_b
----

All methods can be referenced by symbol as shown via `:join` above. Using a symbol is syntactic sugar for link:https://rubyapi.org/o/object#method-i-method[Object#method] so the use of the `:join` symbol is the same as using `method(:join)`. Both work but the former requires less typing than the latter.

===== Custom

If you'd like to define permanent and reusable steps, you can register a custom step which requires you to:

. Define a custom step as a new class.
. Register your custom step along side the existing default steps.

Here's what this would look like:

[source,ruby]
----
module CustomSteps
  class Join < Pipeable::Steps::Abstract
    def initialize(delimiter = "_", **)
      super(**)
      @delimiter = delimiter
    end

    def call(result) = result.fmap { |input| input.join delimiter }

    private

    attr_reader :delimiter
  end
end

Pipeable::Steps::Container.register :join, CustomSteps::Join

include Pipeable

pipe :a, insert(:b), join, as(:to_sym)
# Yields: Success :a_b

pipe :a, insert(:b), join(""), as(:to_sym)
# Yields: Success :ab
----

=== Containers

Should you not want the basic steps, need custom steps, or a hybrid of default and custom steps, you can define your own container and provide it as an argument to `.[]` when including pipeable behavior. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
require "containable"

module CustomContainer
  extend Containable

  register :echo, -> result { result }
  register :insert, Pipeable::Steps::Insert
end

include Pipeable[CustomContainer]

pipe :a, echo, insert(:b)

# Yields: Success [:a, :b]
----

The above is a hybrid example where the `CustomContainer` registers a custom `echo` step along with the default `insert` step to make a new container. This is included when passed in as an argument via `.[]` (i.e. `include Pipeable[CustomContainer]`).

Whether you use default, custom, or hybrid steps, you have maximum flexibility using this approach.

=== Composition

Should you ever need to make a plain old Ruby object functionally composable, then you can _include_ the `Pipeable::Composable` module which will give you the necessary `\#>>`, `#<<`, and `#call` methods where you only need to implement the `#call` method.

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/pipeable
cd pipeable
bin/setup
----

You can also use the IRB console for direct access to all objects:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

=== Architecture

The architecture of this gem is built on top of the following concepts and gems:

* {function_composition_link}: Made possible through the use of the `\#>>` and `#<<` methods on the link:https://rubyapi.org/3.1/o/method[Method] and link:https://rubyapi.org/3.1/o/proc[Proc] objects.
* {containable_link}: Allows related dependencies to be grouped together for injection as desired.
* {dry_monads_link}: Critical to ensuring the entire pipeline of steps adhere to the {railway_pattern_link} and leans heavily on the `Result` object.
* link:https://alchemists.io/projects/marameters[Marameters]: Through the use of the `.categorize` method, dynamic message passing is possible by inspecting the operation method's parameters.

=== Style Guide

* *Transactions*
** Use a single method (i.e. `#call`) which is public and adheres to the {command_pattern_link} so transactions can be piped together if desired.
* *Steps*
** Inherit from the `Abstract` class to gain monad, composition, and dependency behavior. This allows subclasses to have direct access to the base positional, keyword, and block arguments. These variables are prefixed with `base_*` in order to not conflict with subclasses which might only want to use non-prefixed variables for convenience.
** All filtered arguments -- in other words, the unused arguments -- need to be passed up to the superclass from the subclass (i.e. `super(*positionals, **keywords, &block)`). Doing so allows the superclass (i.e. `Abstract`) to provide access to `base_positionals`, `base_keywords`, and `base_block` for use if desired by the subclass.
** The `#call` method must define a single positional `result` parameter since a monad will be passed as an argument. Example: `def call(result) = # Implementation`.
** Each block within the `#call` method should use the `input` parameter to be consistent. More specific parameters like `argument` or `operation` should be used to improve readability when possible. Example: `def call(result) = result.bind { |input| # Implementation }`.
** Use implicit blocks sparingly. Most of the default steps shy away from using blocks because it can make the code more complex. Use private methods, custom steps, and/or separate transactions if the code becomes too complex because you might have a smaller object which needs extraction.

=== Debugging

If you need to debug (i.e. {debug_link}) your pipe, use a lambda. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
pipe data,
     check(/Book.+Price/, :match?),
     -> result { binding.break },  # Breakpoint
     :parse
----

The above breakpoint will allow you inspect the result of the `#check` step and/or build a modified result for passing to the subsequent `:parse` method step.

=== Troubleshooting

The following might be of aid to as you implement your own transactions.

==== Type Errors

If you get a `TypeError: Step must be functionally composable and answer a monad`, it means:

. The step must be a `Proc`, `Method`, or some object which responds to `\#>>`, `#<<`, and `#call`.
. The step doesn't answer a result monad (i.e. `Success some_value` or `Failure some_value`).

==== No Method Errors

If you get a `NoMethodError: undefined method `success?` exception, this might mean that you forgot to add a comma after one of your steps. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
# Valid
pipe "https://www.wikipedia.org",
     to(client, :get),
     try(:parse, catch: HTTP::Error)

# Invalid
pipe "https://www.wikipedia.org",
     to(client, :get)  # Missing comma.
     try(:parse, catch: HTTP::Error)
